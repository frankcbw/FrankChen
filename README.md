## Welcome to Frank's GitHub Page
My name is Binwei (Frank) Chen. 

I am a 4th year undergraduate student at University of Toronto (St. George Campus), majoring in Computer Science (Focus in Artificial Intelligence) with a Statistic Science Minor.

I am strongly interested in rapidly changing new technologies and I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge in the real world. I am currently looking for full-time jobs starting Summer 2021. (Also seeking part-time oppourtunities starting January 2021!)

Feel free to reach out and connect with me at <frankchen0717@gmail.com>!
