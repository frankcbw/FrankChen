## Welcome to Frank's GitHub Page
My name is Binwei (Frank) Chen. 

I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at University of Toronto (St. George Campus), majoring in Computer Science with a Statistic Science Minor.

I'm a passionate young man who is strongly interested in rapidly changing new technologies and can't wait to leverage my skills and knowledge in the real world. I'm currently looking for full-time jobs starting Summer 2021.
